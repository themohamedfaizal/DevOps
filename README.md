# DevOps

A compound of development **(Dev)** and operations **(Ops)**, DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers.


- DevOps enables the Organization's ability to deliver application and services at high velocity.
- This rapid development enables organisations to better serve the customers and compete more effectively in the market.
- DevOps is a set of practices, tools and a cultural philosophy.
- It emphasizes team empowerment, collaboration and technology automation.

# Why DevOps

## Before DevOps
 
- Developers, developed the code
- Operations Team, deployed the code in Servers. And continously supported and monitored the environment.

## Issues

- Code works in Developers Environment.
- Code does not work in Operations Environment.
- software development and IT operations communities raised concerns about this traditional software development model.

## Solution

- DevOps, a combination of the words development and operations, reflects the process of integrating these disciplines into one, continuous process.
- DevOps enables formerly siloed roles—development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security—to coordinate and collaborate to produce better, more reliable products.


# How DevOps Works

- Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” 
- Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle.
  - from development
  - and test 
  - to deployment 
  - to operations.

- Teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow. 
- They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. 
- These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team’s velocity.

## Benefits of DevOps

- Rapid Delivery
- Reliability
- Scale
- Improved Collaboration
- Security.
